# input:
i.e. ciphered text : ZOLSS{W1G_D3HY_4_T45R}
key = 7

NOTE: donot change the numbers and the special charecters.( '{' , '}' , '_' )
# solution

with the use of python or manually just by shifting the alphabets by the given key to right. (it is an example for ceaser cipher.)
or from the python file just by calling decoder function we get the decrypted text.
